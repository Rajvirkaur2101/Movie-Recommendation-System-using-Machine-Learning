    "### Hybrid model\n",
    "\n",
    "A Hybrid Recommendation System combines two or more recommendation techniques—such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and popularity-based methods—to generate more accurate, personalized, and robust recommendations. Each individual approach has its strengths and limitations. For instance, collaborative filtering can suffer from the cold start problem for new users or items, while content-based methods may be limited in diversity. By blending these approaches, hybrid models aim to overcome these weaknesses and leverage the strengths of each method.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of movie recommendations, a hybrid model might use user-item rating patterns (collaborative filtering) and movie metadata like genres or overviews (content-based filtering) together. For example, it can recommend movies that are both similar in content to a movie the user liked and are also liked by users with similar preferences. This leads to more accurate and relevant recommendations, especially in sparse or noisy datasets."

    "\n",
    "- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**  \n",
    "  - Implemented using the `surprise` library.\n",
    "  - SVD is trained on the userId, movieId, rating data and learns latent features (patterns) of user preferences.\n",
    "  - For each content-similar movie found in step 1, the model predicts how much the input user would like that movie using SVD.\n",
    "\n",
    "#####  **Step 3: Hybrid Scoring**\n",
    "\n",
    "The system combines both content and collaborative filtering using a hybrid score:\n",
    "\n",
    "hybrid_score = (vote_average + svd_score) / 2\n",
    "\n",
    "* vote_average captures how good the movie is generally (public opinion).\n",

    "* svd_score captures how likely the specific user is to enjoy the movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Movies are then sorted by this hybrid score, and the top-N are returned as recommendations.\n"
